# Getting this to work

This is intended to demonstrate using Native Bindings to C from Crystal

1. Install Crystal and a C compiler (https://crystal-lang.org/reference/installation/)
  - Only need to run two commands to install Crystal on Debian & Ubuntu:
    -```curl -sSL https://dist.crystal-lang.org/apt/setup.sh | sudo bash```
    -```sudo apt install crystal```
2. Clone this repo somewhere
3. `cd` into `crystal_to_c/`
4. Run `make` to compile the C and Crystal code
5. Run `./main`
6. If the output showed "Hello, World" and a 15, then it worked!!
7. Now step through the code to figure out how all this worked

# Notes

Here are some explanations of what's there

* `Makefile` was generated by me (Tim) to handle compiling the C and building Crystal code
* `Hello.c` is where the C code is written. Nothing special needed to be done, any normal C code works!
* `main.cr` is where I made the call from Crystal and defined what was in the C code for Crystal to use
	- You only need to define the functions you want to use and can ignore any extra ones in a file
