# Native Bindings Examples

This is a collection of simple examples of Native bindings, collected for the RIT SE course Software Performance Engineering. But who knows? It might work for other people too.

## Structure

Each interpreted language has its own folder in this repository. Most languages have multiple ways to bind to native code. Each approach is located in its own subfolder, which should also have a readme to explain how to use it.


## Contributions

Contributions are welcome!! The more examples we have, the better. In fact, maybe your professor will give extra credit for a pull request ;)

Examples we would love to have:
* Ruby to Rust 
* Python to C 
* JS to C example using nodejs
* Java to C
* Windows instructions for any and all examples
* Mac instructions for any and all examples

Ideally your example should work on Nitron because then most students will be able to work with it.
